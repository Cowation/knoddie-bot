# knoddie-bot
*Knoddie, serving people with a place to stay for 10 years!*

## Information
This bot is only on GitHub for hosting use. This bot will not be available to the public.
`node_modules` is in .gitignore due to it being super nasty when making changes.
`token` is in a variable that nobody can access. Seriously did you think I would leak that?

## Development Status
This bot will probably stay as is, but if there are any major bugs that I need to fix, I will come back to it.
